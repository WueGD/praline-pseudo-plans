# praline-pseudo-plans

This repository is about cable plans represented in praline graph format (see the praline-core repository below)

## Structure

This repository contains a directory with Java code for generating pseudo praline graphs in json format for a given base set of praline graphs.

Further, it contains a directory with jsons of pseudo cable plans in praline format that were generated with the Java code. Note that the original cable plans, where the pseudo cable plans are based on, are not publicly available.
These cable plans are good data sets to be drawn with the praline-core graph drawing library (see next).

## Funding

Substantial parts of this library were developed in the context of the project iPRALINE – grant ZF4117505 (interaktive Problemanalyse und -lösung in komplexen industriellen Netzwerken)
from 2019–2021, which has been funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy as part of the ZIM (Zentrales Innovationsprogramm Mittelstand) funding program.
